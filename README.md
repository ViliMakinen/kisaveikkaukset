This project was done as a hobby project for FIFA World Cup 2022. 

Basic idea:

- users can create groups and invite their friends to the group with a code
- once users have joined a group, they will see all active groups for them when logged in
- users can make predictions of the group stage results ( 1 X 2 -format ) before the tournament begins
- users can also make additional predictions of the whole tournament ( best goal scorers etc. ) before the tournament begins
- when the tournament begins, predictions are locked and cannot be changed
- when admin-users input the correct results of individual games, the points of each user in a group is updated and shown to all users of the group

Utilizes:

- Angular
- Typescript
- Node.js
- NestJS
- Prisma.io
- Google Oauth2
- Docker
- Heroku
