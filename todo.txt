// 1. Create a new landing page design (for mobile also).

// 2. Move the 'create group' -stuff to its own page and create a small button on the landing page to access it.

// 3. Align the starting date of matches to be consistent.

// 4. Create a new login page and include google.

// 5. Create a AuthGuard that checks if userServices user is set or is null. This guard would prevent the user from accessing any routes except for / and /authorization.

// 6. Create another guard that checks if the group code is valid.

 7. Create a 'final' data structure for users predictions and create it dynamically as the user changes the predictions.

//8. Add a 'save' button where users can ultimately submit the predictions (for now this can just console.log the predictions).
     - when submitted, the predictions get locked
     - userService would have a field called arePredictionsLocked and manipulate this variable

 9. Add a final date that the 'save' button can be pressed - this should probably come from the tournaments' info?
     - How to programmatically disable a button

 10. Create additional information ball for save button that disables after predictions are full.
    - - create a 'unlock' button for development purposes
